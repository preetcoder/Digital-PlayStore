# Project was a standalone digital market place that allows users to browse and download mobile applications. The PlayStore also serves as a digital multimedia store offering music, books, magazines, movies and TV programs. Applications and multimedia items in playStore were either free or can be bought for a price. I developed this project in java and used OOPs concepts to develop this project assignment.
